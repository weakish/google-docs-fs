This project aims to allow you to connect to Google Docs and treat it as a file system. Combine the portability of Google Docs with the flexibility and power of using the office suite of your choice.

This will allow you to mount your Google Docs account as you would a normal filesystem. You will then be able to use it as if it were a file system on your hard disk, with all operations being transmitted seamlessly to Google Docs.

Written in Python using the FUSE API, this tool should be portable across all systems that have a FUSE implementation (including Linux, Mac OSX, and FreeBSD).
